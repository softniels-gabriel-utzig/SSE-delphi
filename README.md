# SSE-delphi: Server-Sent Events in Delphi

SSE is a fascinating technology that allows you to send real-time updates from the server to the client over a single, long-lived connection.

## What You Need to Know

To get started, take a look at our [GitHub issue #613](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/issues/613), where you can find the discussions related to this project (and the MVCFramework SSE implementation).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Build the app and run it
3. Open the [index.html](https://github.com/softniels-gabriel-utzig/SSE-delphi/blob/main/index.html) file in your browser. This file serves as your listener to the application.
4. Start submitting events to test the SSE functionality.
